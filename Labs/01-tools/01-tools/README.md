### Blink example

1. What is the meaning of the following binary operators in C?
   * `|`
   * `&`
   * `^`
   * `~`
   * `<<`
   * `>>`

2. Complete truth table with operators: `|`, `&`, `^`, `~`

| **b** | **a** |**b or a** | **b and a** | **b xor a** | **not b** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | 0 |  |  |  |  |
| 0 | 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 1 | 0 |  |  |  |  |
| 1 | 1 |  |  |  |  |


### Morse code

1. Listing of C code with syntax highlighting which repeats one "dot" and one "comma" on a LED:

```c
int main(void)
{
    // Set pin as output in Data Direction Register
    // DDRB = DDRB or 0010 0000
    DDRB = DDRB | (1<<LED_GREEN);

    // Set pin LOW in Data Register (LED off)
    // PORTB = PORTB and 1101 1111
    PORTB = PORTB & ~(1<<LED_GREEN);

    // Infinite loop
    while (1)
    {
        // Pause several milliseconds
        _delay_ms(SHORT_DELAY);

        // WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
    }

    // Will never reach this
    return 0;
}
```


2. Scheme of Morse code application, i.e. connection of AVR device, LED, resistor, and supply voltage. The image can be drawn on a computer or by hand. Always name all components and their values!
